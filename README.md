# bookbusta

## Description

Are you a book lover in search for finding more books and being able to leave or read reviews on other books others have left behind? Then Bookbusta is exactly what you are looking for! This website was built for users to be able to create an account where they cna look up books by title name or genres, be able to add it to their favorite lists or be able to preview the book to see if it is something they will be interested in. Once the book has been added in their favorites, the user can click on the book title leave a comment about their thoughts and feelings on it.
Bookbusta is a convenient way to search for books, create a book history for yourself, leave reviews for yourself, and read others. Building this website, got to utilize Front-End and Back-End skills together to achieve Bookbusta to how it is.
